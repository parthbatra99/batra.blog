I am Parth Batra. A BITS-Pilani'22 graduate.
Currently, I work as a data scientist at [Procol](www.procol.io).
Previously, I worked at Genpact as in AI Engineer in 2021 and Brightchamps in 2022. 
I also worked as an contractor for a few months with an Israeli Startup in 2022.
After that gig, i joined Procol as full time Data-Scientist in Gurugram.

I am a tinkerer kind of an engineer. I like to break and reconstruct things all the time. So, you might have already guessed it - my day-to-day IDE is neovim. PopOS is my Operating system of my choice.
Since most of my day involves around typing, a carry a good mechanical keyboard with me most of the time. At my work, i use Aluminium+RGB Backlit+Hot-Swap Keychron K8 (prefer more than K2 layout honestly).
In my work setup, i use my custom mod of Infamous TVS Gold (my first ever keyboard from 10 years ago) which was my first keyboard mod. Probably the best sounding keyboard i have seen. You can check how i did it here.
